>

## Run the application:
> ,/GameOfLife

## Application usage:
When application starts there should be ImGui window to provide the information
to setup the Game of Life and providing the details about how to run game.

- Decide the game area width and height.
(No more than 10k cells can be created - arbitary limit set be me.)
- Select the initial cells to activate when the game starts
- Click the apply button on the top and the Game should start.

### Keybindings:
> Arrow keys to move camera
>
> Mouse wheel to zoom in/out
>
> 'x' proceed a step in game in manual mode
>
> 'space' toggle mode between manual/automatic
>
> 'r' If manual mode is toggled on -> initializes game area again with random cells
>
> 'esc' close the program (Also the 'x' button on window does the same)
>
